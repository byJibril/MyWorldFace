    <h1 class="pages-title">Pollution</h1>

    <h1 class="pages-text">The pollution caused by human activities has reached alarming levels, negatively affecting every corner of our planet. The burning of fossil fuels for energy and transportation releases enormous amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, exacerbating climate change and its devastating impacts, such as global temperature rise, glacier melting, and sea-level rise.</h1>

    <h1 class="pages-text">Additionally, air pollution, caused by the emission of toxic gases and particles, is responsible for millions of premature deaths each year and contributes to respiratory diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. Likewise, water pollution, caused by industrial, agricultural, and residential discharge, contaminates rivers, lakes, and oceans, endangering aquatic life and compromising the health of those who depend on these water sources for consumption.</h1>

    <h1 class="pages-text">The uncontrolled generation of plastic waste is another serious environmental concern. Tons of plastic end up in the oceans each year, threatening marine life and contaminating aquatic ecosystems. Furthermore, the accumulation of plastics in soils and landfills poses a long-term problem, as these materials can take hundreds of years to decompose, releasing toxic substances and affecting soil fertility.</h1>

    <h1 class="pages-text">Moreover, preserving biodiversity is essential for maintaining ecosystem stability and ensuring our food and health security. Plants, animals, and microorganisms play vital roles in climate regulation, crop pollination, and water purification, among other ecosystem services fundamental to our survival.</h1>

    <h1 class="pages-text">Caring for the planet is not only a matter of ethical responsibility but also self-interest. By protecting and preserving natural resources and ecosystems, we ensure a sustainable future for present and future generations. Change begins with each of us, adopting more sustainable lifestyles and advocating for more effective environmental policies at local, national, and international levels. Together, we can make a difference and build a cleaner, healthier, and more equitable world for all.</h1>
