<h1 class="proposito">These are some of the causes of this serious situation. We must stop carrying out these activities in order to save our planet. I know you're wondering why I seek to care for our planet. At first, I also thought the same, but I realized the great value our planet holds and the damage we cause it with these activities is very strong. So that you understand better, pollution destroys our forests, oceans, beaches, and the environment we inhabit. Deforestation depletes our natural resources and causes climate change, which severely impacts our surroundings. Finally, we have poaching, which is the illegal hunting of species, whether terrestrial or marine. This leads to the extinction of species in our environment and can cause a serious imbalance in their ecosystems due to the lack of predators or sustenance for other animals. Natural resources are depleting, and animals will eventually die. When that moment comes, everything will be over, and remember, what's done is done.</h1>
